    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is fundamental to web development, serving as the structure and skeleton of a webpage. It allows developers to organize and display a variety of content, such as text, images, videos, links, and interactive elements, in a way that web browsers can interpret and present to users. HTML uses a set of predefined tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code>), to mark up content. For example, the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag defines the most important heading, while <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> creates hyperlinks, and <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> are used to group and style sections of content.</p>

    <p>HTML is also important for accessibility, as screen readers and other assistive technologies rely on semantic HTML tags to interpret the content correctly for users with disabilities. Tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> help define the layout and structure of a webpage in a meaningful way. HTML also facilitates embedding external resources, such as images, videos, and audio, with elements like <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, HTML forms the foundation for interactive web applications. The <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag, combined with input elements like <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>, enables user interaction, such as submitting information to a server. Although HTML is a markup language focused on structure, its integration with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for behavior and interactivity) empowers developers to create visually appealing and dynamic websites.</p>

    <p>With the ongoing evolution of HTML, newer features like HTML5 have introduced enhanced capabilities for multimedia integration, local storage, geolocation, and more, making it a versatile and ever-growing tool for modern web development.</p>
